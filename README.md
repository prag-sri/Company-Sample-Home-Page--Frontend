# Company-Sample-Home-Page-Frontend

Start by creating a black navbar that takes up 100% of the width of the page. The background color should be set to black.

Add a heading under the navbar. Below the heading, add some placeholder text using the p tag.

Add a button under the placeholder text. Wrap the button in an a tag and set the href attribute to "https://www.lipsum.com/". The styling of the button is not important, but it can be added if desired.

Below the button, add another heading and an image of your choice. The image can be sourced from Google Images by setting the src attribute of the img tag.

Create an ordered list as shown in the UI. This can be achieved by using the ol tag and the li tag for each item in the list.

Finally, create an unordered list as shown in the UI using the ul tag and li tag for each item.

The project must be deployed.

Design to be similar to the figma design.
